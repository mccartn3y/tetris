# TETRIS CLI
This is a simple tetris game running in the cli (theoretically cross-platform, but not tested).

This was an "intro to rust" program for myself that I plan to break out into a walkthrough.

To run, download the packaged release and simply run from a command line e.g. `~/Downloads/tetris`
